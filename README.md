# Diverse representation

Technology has the power to drive action. And right now, a call to action is needed to eradicate racism. **Black lives matter.**

We recognize technology alone cannot fix hundreds of years of racial injustice and inequality, but when we put it in the hands of the Black community and their supporters, technology can begin to bridge a gap. To start a dialogue. To identify areas where technology can help pave a road to progress.

This project is an effort to leverage technology to prevent, detect, and remediate bias and misrepresentation in the workplace, products, and society. For corporations to succeed, it is critical to have Black representation at every level.

This is one of three open source projects underway as part of the [Call for Code Emb(race) Spot Challenge](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code) led by contributors from IBM and Red Hat.

3. [Bias is learned and perpetuated in different ways](#problem-statement-3)

## Problem statement 1

Black employees do not advance at the rate and to the levels of influence in the workplace they should due to a lack of transparency around opportunities and implicit biases in recruiting, evaluation, mentorship and promotion processes.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. A recruiter can receive data-driven recommendations of non-traditional applicants to reconsider and be confident in advocating for them to hiring managers.

2. A performance reviewer can receive real-time feedback and suggestions on possible bias in their evaluations.

3. An employee can know how common the microaggressions they face at work is arewithout talking to others.

4. A senior manager can quantify and receive recommendations on their team's inclusivity of Black employees in high visibility discussions and opportunities, and the diversity of their in-office communications in an easy to navigate dashboard.

### How tech can help

* Data visualization, machine-learning-based recommendation systems, predictive analytics and bias detection algorithms are powerful tools for workplace use to increase transparency and reduce bias in the hiring, retention, and promotion pipeline.

* Universities and High Schools databases showing graduation and dropout rate. With high emphasis on the success rate so that it can be emulated in other errors.

## Problem statement 2

Real-word bias influences inputs into algorithms, creating algorithmic biases in technology. The effect of thesebiases can range from misrepresentation of the expected end users to inequitable practices in decision making algorithms and consequently possible gap widening.


### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. A data scientist can identify bias intraining dataand receive corrected data samples to improve training data in less than an hour.

2. A developer can test their algorithms for bias on diverse datasets and receive recommendations on how to de-bias their algorithms.

3. An end user can access explainable data on an algorithm they are using to understand its implicit assumptions and biases without any coding knowledge.

### How tech can help

Reducing algorithmic biases requires a concerted conscience effort by diverse human-in-the-loop teams with robust algorithmic evaluation and development. Evaluation metrics, bias-mitigation algorithms, and dashboards have critical roles to help teams reduce potential biases in their products.

## Problem statement 3

Bias is learned and perpetuated in different ways (e.g. societal beliefs, misrepresentation, ignorance) that consequently create inequitable outcomes across all spheres of life.

### How tech can help

Mobile and web applications can be used to help individuals tackle their own bias.Bias detection algorithms, machine learning based recommendation systems, chatbots, and predictive analytics are powerful tools to underpin these applications.Such technology has impactful use in various forms of media to more fairly diversely represent people qualitatively (by capturing a range of identifiable characteristics, beliefs, personas, interests, cultures) and quantitatively (by increasing overall and stratified numbers).A by-product of such interventions is the elimination of incorrect biased stereotypes that have historically plagued media content generation and natural language.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. A media content editor (e.g., audio, gaming, movies, tv, comics, news, publications) can incorporate bias detection and remediation into their creative process to reduce racial bias 
and improve representation to [Gen Z][<vw: why Gen Z only?Could this be more broadly applicable to all media consumers?]media consumers.

2. A media consumer can track the quantity and bias in their consumption of content from [Black][<vw: “Black” is changed to “black” above; let’s be consistent]creators or about Black people in an easy interface.

3. A social media user can understand the historical and societal context of racial bias and cultural appropriation reflected in their posts in real time.

4. A doctor can identify their bias and discrepancies in clinical recommendations for Black patients without manual comparison of patients' notes.
